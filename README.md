## How to perform crop on a video in Kdenlive ?
Answer:

There are 2 ways to perform crop.

1. To apply the Crop Effect, click on the video clip in the Timeline to select it.
   - Go to `Effects` tab on the top right panel.
   - In the search bar under the Effects tab, type “Crop”.
   - Drag the `Crop (Center)` effect or simply `Crop` (depending on your version of Kdenlive) onto your video clip in the Timeline.

2. With the video clip selected in the Timeline, go to the `Effect Stack` tab --> `Transform, Distort and Perspective` which is also on the right panel.
   - You will see the Crop effect listed there. Click on it and go to `crop by padding`.
   - Adjust the `Left`, `Right`, `Top`, and `Bottom` values to control how much of each edge to crop. The adjustments can be made using the sliders or by entering values manually to get precise control.
